install
edit / preferences / addon / install (mirror.py) (not zip) extracted it. 
in N panel /  tools 
it has 3 axis (XYZ) . 

Attention / this addon works with the oigin of object. You have to change origin point anywhere. it souldn not be center of the object.
This allows to you create mirror easly. Actually it uses the mirror modifier but you dont have to use modifer and other options. just a single click and it mirrored. 

Thanks
